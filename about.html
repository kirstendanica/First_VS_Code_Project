      <h1>Discover Macaroni and Cheese</h1>
      <h2>History and Origins</h2>
      <p><strong>Thanks to Thomas Jefferson,</strong> macaroni and cheese has become popularized
      and loved by many around the world as a delicious and accessible meal. Let us rewind this back a bit to get some more
      reference.
    </p>
    <p>It actually all started with a fellow named <em>James Hemings.</em> 
      He was a slave who good ol' Thomas Jefferson sent to France to learn how to cook. 
      Along with funding the opulent culinary crash course, Jefferson illegally snuck a pasta maker back from Naples (Italy) so that Hemings could introduce macaroni and cheese to the upper-class
      households of the American South. So while Jefferson and several ads following this situation helped to popularize the dish,
      we can actually <strong>give our credits to James Hemings</strong></p>
    <p>Okay, let's go back even more!</p>
    
    <h3>All Origins Lead to Rome</h3>
    <p>The earliest mention that we have of 
      our macaroni and cheese combination dates back as far as 160 BCE, when Marcus Porcius Cato, ultraconservative senator of the then Roman Republic, wrote his treatise on running a vast country estate, De Agri Cultura. 
      Found inside, he'd included a few recipes for ritual gatherings and holidays that bring together what could be translated as the one and only combo of pasta and fresh cheese. 
      One of the recipes in question went as follows: layers of cheese packed between stacked sheets of whole grain dough. No elbow shapes here, yet. Festive recipes like these became inextricably linked with the taste of pasta and cheese,
      and thus became embedded in the collective memory as a marker of culinary identity.
      <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/ingredients/who-invented-mac-and-cheese" target="_blank">See more information here.</a></p>
    
    <p>Further down the line, it can be learend that our macaroni and cheese, also known as mac and cheese, 
      has its origins in Italy where a similar dish of pasta and cheese called "maccheroni alla mugnaia" was popular. 
      However, the modern version of mac and cheese as we know it today is believed to have originated in the United States, 
      specifically in the northeastern region, during the late 18th century. It was made by combining macaroni pasta with grated cheddar cheese and butter, and it quickly became a popular comfort food in the country. 
      Today, mac and cheese is enjoyed in various forms and variations around the world.</p>

      <h2>Types of Cheese and Pasta</h2>
      <h3>Cheese, please!</h3>

        <div class="cheese-text-container">
        <p>The ideal cheese for mac and cheese depends on individual taste preferences, 
        but the following are some well-liked choices:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cheddar.</strong> It has a flavor that goes well with the pasta and is 
            strong and acidic.</li>
          <li><strong>Gouda.</strong> This is a creamy, nutty cheese that gives mac and cheese a richer flavor.</li>
          <li><strong>Fontina.</strong> Welcome a mild-flavored cheese that pairs nicely with other cheeses since it is creamy and smooth.</li>
          <li><strong>Gruyere.</strong> This is my personal favorite for baked macaroni and cheese, 
            <a href="https://www.thechunkychef.com/family-favorite-baked-mac-and-cheese/" target="_blank">seen in this recipe.</a>
